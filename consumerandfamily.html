<h1>My Fall 2018 Semester</h1>
<h2>Consumer and Family Finances </h2>
<h3> Mrs. Goldsmith </h3>
<p1> This class is a very practical class I am taking during my fall semester. This class has taught me how to understand credit, mortgage and many other things that have real world applications. This class has 3 main exams and one budget paper where you value your main assets and liabilities. Going forward when I graduate I will use this information to purchase my first house, buy my first car and get my first credit card. I would recommend this class to all students at Virginia Tech. </p1>
