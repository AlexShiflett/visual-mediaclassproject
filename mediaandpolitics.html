<h1>My Fall 2018 Semester</h1>
<h2>Media and Politics </h2>
<h3> Mr. Kuypers </h3>
<p1> This class is all about how media affects he political world. We learn how opponents attack each other and how they promote their own agenda. This class has 2 main exams with a paper and presentation final. Being prepared for this class is key as we discuss videos of ads and how they were used and viewed. Coming into class I never got into the political scene, but this class has raised my interest to see how people run their campaigns has made me a more educated voter. </p1>
