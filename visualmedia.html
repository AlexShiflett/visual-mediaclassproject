<h1>My Fall 2018 Semester</h1>
<h2>Visual Media</h2>

<h3> Mr. Evia </h3>

<p1> This class is unlike any other Iâ€™m taking this semester. We learned the art of photo taking, video editing, website design and pamphlet making. We have got to use the systems like InDesign, Photoshop and many other Adobe software systems. This class is very hands on and lets you do learn the systems through use. The class will help me personally with my career after school. I would recommend this class to anyone with a desire for media related creations.</p1>
