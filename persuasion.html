<h1>My Fall 2018 Semester</h1>
<h2>Persuasion </h2>

<h3>Mrs. Waggenspeck</h3>

<p1>This class shows how people motivate others while speaking. We have learned how messages work on individuals and how we should focus our messages for each specific audience. This class has 3 main exams and a homework portion to make up our grade. This class would help any students who will be going into public speaking or who will be a leader in their organization. It has taught me everyone responds to messages different and you need to know your approach in order to get the best effects. </p>
