<h1>My Fall 2018 Semester</h1>
<h2>Housing and The Consumer</h2>
<h3> Ms. Wimmer </h3>
<p1> This class has examples of how homes differ and how you should look into buying them. It is an online class and is a part of my minor. The class has a decent work load with 2 to 3 assignments a week on top of the weekly videos and readings. The class teaches you about different home styles and how they can differ depending on their builds. Going into the class I knew very little about this subject, but I have learned a large amount so far and can use it for when I buy my first home. I recommend this class to any students who are looking to rent or buy a home. </p1>
